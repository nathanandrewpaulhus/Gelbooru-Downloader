Gelbooru Downloader
by Nathan Paulhus

Instructions:

To use the downloader simply enter the desired search tags into the box
on the top of the screen, then press enter. Tags need to be divided with
plus signs.

A series of tags may look like:
wallpaper+rating:safe+score:>25

After pressing enter the program will download all images with those tags, up to 
twenty thousand pictures, which is the max back images Gelbooru will let the
user view when this program was created.

When they're are no more images left to download, the program will let you know
through the console. Error messages are also reported through the console.
